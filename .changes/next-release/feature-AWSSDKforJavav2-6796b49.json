    "description": "Added a `profileFile` and `profileName` option to the client override configuration. Setting this configuration value is equivalent to setting the environment or system properties for the profile file and profile name. Specifically, it sets the default profile file and profile name used by the client. If the profile is configured in both the environment variable and the client override configuration, the client override configuration is used."
